<h2>The MemeGenerator App</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>A React app that can quickly generate memes for you. It's integrated with the Imgflip API, which provides us with the most popular meme images at the moment. This project is part of my React learning path to practice event listeners, State(useState), conditional rendering, forms, useEffect, etc.</p>
<h3>How does it work</h3>
<p>
1) Click on the button to fetch a new meme image <br />
2) Fill out the input fields, which correspond to the top and bottom text<br />
3) Now you can save your image and share your meme easily; if you don't like the meme provided, just click the button to load another one ðŸ˜‰<br />
